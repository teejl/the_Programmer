# I will start by using the link instructions below to create a super user and block access to root user
# https://www.raspberrypi.org/documentation/linux/usage/root.md

# Interesting Notes:
# whenever one types a command in the terminal the /usr/bin/ is called ex: -> pip; executes /usr/bin/pip
# the users are stored /home/
# cat /proc/version [to check linux version]

# USEFUL COMMANDS
# https://www.makeuseof.com/tag/15-useful-commands-every-raspberry-pi-user-should-know/
# pwd [print working directory]
# mkdir [make directory]
# ls [look in folder]
# cd [move to folder]
# cat /proc/cpuinfo [show computer specs (hardware)]
# cat /proc/meminfo

# sudo visudo (To edit the groups with access and rootpaths (init of accesses))
# sudo usermod -aG sudo username (add teej as a sudo user)
# sudo gpasswd -a username sudo (apparently same as above but this seemed to be better than above)
# [The articles then moves on to talklke about groups aand access for these groups] - I will skip this step
# The access often talks about moving to the /usr/bin/ file path. This seems to be where all the executables are located
# an example of a file here is apt-get, python3, git, and just about everything else.
# path for users: /home/
# sudo -config [for commands]
# sudo raspi-config [to config with setup] - user friendly
