# I will start by using the link instructions below to create a super user and block access to root user

# --- Start to Basic Tutorial Here --- [Logged Commands]

# BECOMING SUPER USER
# sudo <command>
# sudo su
# su (with password)
# exit (to leave su)

# ADDING USER:
# sudo adduser teej
# type: passwd
# type: passwd
# <enter>
# <enter>
# <enter>
# <enter>
# <enter>
# Y

# RESTRICTING ACCESS TO PARTICULAR USERS:
# https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-edit-the-sudoers-file-on-ubuntu-and-centos
# sudo visudo (To edit the groups with access and rootpaths (init of accesses))
# sudo usermod -aG sudo username (add teej as a sudo user)
# sudo gpasswd -a username sudo (apparently same as above but this seemed to be better than above)
# [The articles then moves on to talklke about groups aand access for these groups] - I will skip this step
# The access often talks about moving to the /usr/bin/ file path. This seems to be where all the executables are located
# an example of a file here is apt-get, python3, git, and just about everything else.
# path for users: /home/
# sudo -config [for commands]
