## Directory Blueprints

A directory is very important to a programmer. It is his library. His list of files, programs, pictures, and any other form of data or machine. So it is very important to have a clean directory, unless living dirty is your style. However not knowing what you have or where the things I use day to day is not my style.

Task-Oriented Directory
    A task oriented Directory is a directory that organizes all of the files based on some different tasks. Let us call this TO-D style directories for short. A TO-D style directory is good for a work scenario. The beauty of this type of Directory is that we can name the files and folders based on given dates. So whenever the files are sorted they can be sorted by the date they are produced for. Furthermore whenever these files/folders are sorted by name the most recent folder/file is on top. The older files are on the bottom and the list goes on. As the list grows large we can create an "Archive" folder at the bottom. We can then chop the list to any size that we feel by putting the excess files/folders into the archive folder. Hopefully they will be files so there will be less of a f.legnth(). Then the files will be sorted within the archive folder if any older dated files need to be retrieved. How exciting!
     
   An example of how the file names would look for a task called Lawn Mowing could be as follows:
     
       Lawn Mowing [Folder]
        
           
            
            2017 04-01_Lawn Mowing_Workbook.xlsx
            
            2017 03-01_Lawn Mowing_Workbook.xlsx
            
            2017 02-01_Lawn Mowing_Workbook.xlsx
            
            2017 01-01_Lawn Mowing_Workbook.xlsx
            
            
           Archive [Folder]
            
                2016 12-01_Lawn Mowing_Workbook.xlsx
                
                2016 11-01_Lawn Mowing_Workbook.xlsx
                
                2016 10-01_Lawn Mowing_Workbook.xlsx
                
                ...
                
                
As we can see the most recent files are on top whenever we sort the folders by name. As the list grows old the files stack towards the bottom. As the stack grows long we simply dump the lower end of the stack into the Archive folder. The Archive folder holds all of the prior files. They are sorted by date so there is a way to navigate around the folder.
    
As far as I know Microsoft hasn't implemented a method to shift the name to where we can switch workbook with the date, but that would make our folder even more organized. It would allow for sorting the files with more than just the date. However on the bright side microsoft does allow to sort by last changed date and size of the file.
    
This so far is my favorite way to name my financial reports. The reason is becaue it is super organized and it allows growth for optimizing each task. By splitting each folder into each task I must do it helps me keep all of my thoughts in one place. Of course the best way to organize data imo is on one big server and then pulling the report directly. However this can take very long for each report to pull. Thus this is the machine learning way of doing the report. It is quicker, but it lacks flexibility.
    
One day I would like to build a system where the information is in one place and any analysis I would like to pull can be pulled directly from the server. Like running a report with an sql statement. But I need the report to have pictures. Everything just makes more sense with pictures right?

## Python Bias

As I continue my journey into programming I notice that choosing the language is sometimes the most difficult part. Personally I am a fan of Python, but that is because it is free software. There are also great options like VBA because in the workplace everyone uses Excel. Identifying the correct programming language comes down to what is the purpose of the language? 

I am not writing to display the number of purposes out there for each language, for if I did I would surely miss many purposes. A lot of the languages can achieve the same job. Instead I present my purpose as a motivation to other programmers out there in the Universe. 

My purpose is simple: I want the computer to work for me to stimulate my intellectual mind. That is, any redundant and mundane task I have I want to be able to create a computer to do it for me. I will be in control of making the decisions of what information to gather, what decisions to make based off the information, and the methods to perform on the set of data. However gathering the information, presenting the information, and manually calculating the information is up to my expertise as a programmer.

I hope to one day achieve the potential to leverage my programming to maximum intellectual insight.

A very helpful line for installing python packages:

    >>py -m pip install {package}

## Python Stock Tracker

I have begun some programming with Python and UiPath to track stock prices and simulate my custom portfolio.

I have made a UiPath script that will retrieve stock prices for each of the indexes I have chosen automatically. I am retrieving the open price for each stock, and plan on tracking the prices over time to see where I would be through a portfolio simulation. It is tough to do a simulation since it take a lot of patience.

I have just recently found out that there is a googlefinance package for python. This makes the tasks I am doing in UiPath slow. It seems that if I keep down this path it is better to know Python then C++ since these two languages can help one master practice and production respectively.

My next move is to start reading "Python for Finance". It is sponsored by the Python Quants Group. I am very interested in one day participating in the program, but before I make such a commitment I want to know where I stand with Python for Finance.

On the side I will keep running my ratchet UiPath and Python stock tracker. There are always insights to be made mathematically despite the lack of programming knowledge.

## TPQ

The python quants have great resources to learn more python and financial mathematics. I have started to post the progress with my lessons. I have learned so much in the past week. It has completely reconstructed the way I gather data, and my methods for analyzing whether to buy a stock or not. Most methods seem to be around high frequency trading, but I hope to find one that comes out of low frequency trading.
