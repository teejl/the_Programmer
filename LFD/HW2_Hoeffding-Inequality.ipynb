    "Run a Computer simulation for flipping 1,000 virtual fair coins. Flip each coin independently 10 times. Focus on 3 coins as follows: $c_1$ is the first coin flipped, $c_{\\text{rand}}$ is a coin chosen randomly from the 1,000, and $c_{\\text{min}}$ is the coin which had the minimum frequency of heads (pick the earlier one in case of a tie). Let $v_1$, $v_{\\text{rand}}$, and $v_{\\text{min}}$ be the <em>fraction</em> of heads obtained for the 3 respective coins out of the 10 tosses.\n",
